# georepca1
Code base for analyses and main figures in Lee, Keinath, Cianfarano and Brandon (2025). Identifying representational structure in CA1 to benchmark theoretical models of cognitive mapping. Neuron 113(2): 307-320. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2024.10.027

Create virtual environment to run code using the environment.yml file: $ conda env create --name georepca1 --file environment.yml

Dataset can be freely downloaded from Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13993254) and manually added to the "georepca1/data" folder.

To run all main analyses and generate figures, you can either run main.py after defining your local path to the georepca1 folder, or follow through Jupyter notebooks located in the "georepca1/demos" folder.
Note that some results build across notebooks, and thus each should be run to completion before moving onto the next.
