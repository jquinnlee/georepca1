# Setup and running code

To run code with all dependencies installed you can **create virtual environment from the environment.yml file** in the command line: 
```
$ conda env create --name georepca1 --file environment.yml
```
Dataset can be freely downloaded from **Zenodo** (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13993254) and **manually added to the "georepca1/data" folder**.

To run all main analyses and generate figures, you can **either run main.py** after defining your local path to the georepca1 folder, or follow through **Jupyter notebooks** located in the "georepca1/demos" folder.
*Note that some results build across notebooks, and thus each should be run to completion before moving onto the next.*

# Data organization

The dataset (Python joblib files or MATLAB .mat files) are given names of animal IDs from the original study that can be downloaded from Zenodo and contain the following fields in each file:

**SFPs**: spatial footprints (also known as ROI) for every registered cell, centered over each cell. Shape - Dimx, dimy, number of SFPs (ROIs), number of days. If cell is not registered it will be nan along dimx and dimy for a given day.

**blocked**: location of blocked (occluded) partitions in 3x3 design of environment. Location of partitions are shown in paper, but are organized in the following way – [[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8]]. If no partitions are blocked, value is -1.

**centroids**: centroid of spatial footprint. Shape – number of cells, x-y location, number of days.

**envs**: environment shape identified with string name 

**maps**: three types of maps generated from the dataset. “sampling” is the occupancy of animal in each spatial bin, shape – xbins, ybins, number of days. “smoothed” is the event rate map smoothed with 2.5 cm gaussian kernel, shape – xbins, ybins, number of cells, number of days. “unsmoothed” is the same event rate map data without smoothing.

**position**: x-y position data for all days. List shape number of days, with shape on each day indicating x-y position in first dimension, and number of temporal bins / frames in second dimension.

**trace**: rise-extracted calcium traces, where “1” indicates a significant event. See paper for details on processing pipeline. If cell is not registered on given day, will appear as nan the same shape.
